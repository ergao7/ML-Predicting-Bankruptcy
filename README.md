Bankruptcy prediction is a critical task for financial institutions, investors, and regulators to
assess the financial health and stability of companies. By leveraging historical financial data
and other relevant features, machine learning models can be developed to predict the
likelihood of a company going bankrupt within a certain time frame. This project aims to
explore bankruptcy prediction using a dataset of companies with known bankruptcy outcomes
and various financial attributes.


The database is downloaded from Fedesoriano Kaggle
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/company-bankruptcy-prediction) which is
sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/572/taiwanese+bankruptcy+prediction).
Additional coding help comes from PSTAT 131 Slides and Labs, Arthur Kim, GitHub Copilot,
and ChatGPT.
